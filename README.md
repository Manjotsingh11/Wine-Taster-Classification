# Wine-Taster-Classification

# WINE QUALITY ANALYSIS
An Entry level project in Data Science on Wine dataset. In this project, I have tried to apply my basic understanding of data science concept so as to build a quality classifier. 

The complete report of the project is available in PROJECT REPORT.pdf

# ABOUT
The whole project has been carried out in R & the appropriate codes have been provided. 

Here we have to rate the wine based on its characteristic.
I have added the comments on the code so as to make it easy to understand at every point.
